**COCO 2014: Common Objects in Context 2014** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains. 

The dataset consists of 164062 images with 1855093 labeled objects belonging to 80 different classes including *person*, *chair*, *car*, and other: *dining table*, *cup*, *bottle*, *bowl*, *handbag*, *truck*, *bench*, *backpack*, *book*, *cell phone*, *sink*, *clock*, *tv*, *potted plant*, *couch*, *dog*, *knife*, *sports ball*, *traffic light*, *cat*, *umbrella*, *bus*, *tie*, *bed*, *train*, and 52 more.

Images in the COCO 2014 dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). There are 41844 (26% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (40775 images), *train* (82783 images), and *val* (40504 images). The dataset was released in 2014 by the COCO Consortium.

Here is a visualized example for 25 randomly selected sample classes:
